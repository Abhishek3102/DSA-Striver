This behavior — **only one swap per step** — is **particular to selection sort**, not shared by all sorting algorithms. Let's compare how swaps work in different sorting techniques:

---

### 🔷 **Selection Sort**

- ✅ **One swap per iteration** (after finding the min/max).
- Comparisons: many per step (to find min/max).
- Swaps: minimal — at most **n - 1**.

---

### 🔷 **Bubble Sort**

- ❌ **Many swaps per iteration**.
- Adjacent elements are compared and **swapped immediately if out of order**.
- A single pass may result in **multiple swaps**, and multiple passes are needed.

Example:
`[5, 3, 1]`

- Compare 5 and 3 → swap → `[3, 5, 1]`
- Compare 5 and 1 → swap → `[3, 1, 5]`
  That's **2 swaps in one pass**.

---

### 🔷 **Insertion Sort**

- ❌ Can have **multiple moves/swaps** per iteration.
- Each new element is **shifted** into its correct place in the sorted part of the array.
- Internally, this involves shifting elements and potentially multiple swaps/moves.

---

### 🔷 **Merge Sort / Quick Sort**

- These use **recursion and divide-and-conquer**, so:

  - ✅ They don’t use "swapping at every step" in the same way.
  - ❌ Can involve **many rearrangements**, depending on the implementation.
  - Swapping isn't done per outer loop iteration — they operate more globally.

### 🔷 Summary

| Sorting Algorithm  | One Swap per Step? | Notes                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Selection Sort** | ✅ Yes             | Swaps only after finding min/max.                   |
| **Bubble Sort**    | ❌ No              | Swaps often during each pass.                       |
| **Insertion Sort** | ❌ No              | Shifts/moves multiple elements.                     |
| **Merge Sort**     | ❌ No              | Recursively combines sorted lists.                  |
| **Quick Sort**     | ❌ No              | Partitions with swaps, not limited to one per step. |

**Conclusion**:
Only **selection sort** is designed to do **just one swap per iteration**, which is one reason it's easy to implement — but not very efficient for large lists.

Absolutely! Let's break down your **C++ selection sort code** step-by-step, explain how it works, and then walk through a complete example to show how it behaves at each step.

## 🔸 Code Overview

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void selection_sort(int arr[], int n)
{
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - 2; i++)
    {
        int mini = i;
        for (int j = i; j <= n - 1; j++)
        {
            if (arr[j] < arr[mini])
            {
                mini = j;
            }
        }
        int temp = arr[mini];
        arr[mini] = arr[i];
        arr[i] = temp;
    }
}

int main()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int arr[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> arr[i];

    selection_sort(arr, n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## 🔸 Step-by-Step Explanation

### 🔹 `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`

- Includes all standard C++ libraries.
- Common in competitive programming.
- Gives access to `iostream`, `vector`, `algorithm`, etc.

---

### 🔹 `using namespace std;`

- So you don’t need to prefix standard functions with `std::` (like `cout`, `cin`, etc.)

---

### 🔹 `void selection_sort(int arr[], int n)`

- Defines the selection sort function that sorts the array `arr` of size `n`.

#### Inside selection_sort:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i <= n - 2; i++)
```

- This is the **outer loop**.
- It runs from index `0` to `n-2` (inclusive).
- Each iteration places the **smallest element from the unsorted part** at index `i`.

```cpp
int mini = i;
```

- `mini` keeps track of the **index of the smallest element** found so far in the inner loop.

```cpp
for (int j = i; j <= n - 1; j++)
```

- This is the **inner loop**.
- It searches the rest of the array (from `i` to `n-1`) for the minimum value.

```cpp
if (arr[j] < arr[mini]) {
    mini = j;
}
```

- Updates `mini` if a smaller element is found.

```cpp
int temp = arr[mini];
arr[mini] = arr[i];
arr[i] = temp;
```

- Swaps the smallest found element (`arr[mini]`) with the element at index `i`.

---

### 🔹 `main()` Function

```cpp
int n;
cin >> n;
```

- Reads the size of the array.

```cpp
int arr[n];
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> arr[i];
```

- Declares an array of size `n` and reads its elements.

```cpp
selection_sort(arr, n);
```

- Calls the sorting function.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << arr[i] << " ";
}
```

- Prints the sorted array.

---

## 🔸 Detailed Example

Suppose the user enters:

```cpp
5
5 3 8 1 2
```

So: `arr = [5, 3, 8, 1, 2]`, `n = 5`

---

### 🔹 Step-by-step Sorting:

#### ✅ Iteration 1 (`i = 0`):

- `mini = 0` → `arr[mini] = 5`
- Inner loop finds minimum:

  - `arr[1] = 3` → smaller → `mini = 1`
  - `arr[3] = 1` → smaller → `mini = 3`

- Swap `arr[0]` and `arr[3]`: `[**1**, 3, 8, **5**, 2]`

#### ✅ Iteration 2 (`i = 1`):

- `mini = 1` → `arr[1] = 3`
- Inner loop:

  - `arr[4] = 2` → smaller → `mini = 4`

- Swap `arr[1]` and `arr[4]`: `[1, **2**, 8, 5, **3**]`

#### ✅ Iteration 3 (`i = 2`):

- `mini = 2` → `arr[2] = 8`
- Inner loop:

  - `arr[3] = 5` → smaller → `mini = 3`
  - `arr[4] = 3` → smaller → `mini = 4`

- Swap `arr[2]` and `arr[4]`: `[1, 2, **3**, 5, **8**]`

#### ✅ Iteration 4 (`i = 3`):

- `mini = 3` → `arr[3] = 5`
- Inner loop:

  - `arr[4] = 8` → no smaller found.

- No need to swap (still does a self-swap): `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]`

---

### 🔹 Final Output:

```
1 2 3 5 8
```

Sorted!

## 🔸 Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:

  - Worst: `O(n²)`
  - Best: `O(n²)` (even if already sorted — always compares)

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` (in-place, no extra array)
