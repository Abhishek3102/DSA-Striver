Great question! The difference between:

```cpp
int removeDuplicatesOptimal(vector<int> &arr, int n)
```

and

```cpp
int removeDuplicatesOptimal(vector<int> arr, int n)
```

is about **passing by reference** (`&arr`) vs **passing by value** (`arr`). Let's break down each approach to understand when and why to use each one.

### 1. **Passing by Reference (`vector<int> &arr`)**:

```cpp
int removeDuplicatesOptimal(vector<int> &arr, int n)
```

- **What does this mean?**

  - `&` in front of `arr` means **pass by reference**.
  - The reference (`&`) creates an alias to the original array passed to the function, meaning any modifications made to `arr` inside the function will directly affect the original array outside the function.

- **When should you use it?**

  - **If you want to modify the original array** and have those changes persist after the function ends.
  - **To avoid copying the array** (especially for large arrays). Passing by reference is more efficient because it doesn't create a copy of the entire array; it just passes the address of the array.

- **Example use case**:

  - In your case, you want to modify the array by removing duplicates in place. By passing the array by reference, you ensure that the changes you make to the array (like shifting elements) will reflect in the original array when you return from the function.

  ```cpp
  vector<int> arr = {1, 1, 2, 3, 3};
  removeDuplicatesOptimal(arr, arr.size());
  // After the function call, arr will be modified directly.
  ```

---

### 2. **Passing by Value (`vector<int> arr`)**:

```cpp
int removeDuplicatesOptimal(vector<int> arr, int n)
```

- **What does this mean?**

  - Passing by value means a **copy** of the array is created and passed to the function.
  - Any changes made to `arr` inside the function will **not affect the original array** outside the function, because `arr` inside the function is just a copy of the original array.

- **When should you use it?**

  - **If you do not need to modify the original array**.
  - **When working with small data**, where copying the array is not a performance concern (though this is usually not efficient for large arrays).
  - **If you want to keep the original array unchanged** for some reason.

- **Example use case**:

  - If you only want to inspect or manipulate the array temporarily (without modifying the original array), passing by value makes sense.

  ```cpp
  vector<int> arr = {1, 1, 2, 3, 3};
  removeDuplicatesOptimal(arr, arr.size());
  // In this case, arr remains the same because a copy was passed to the function.
  ```

### **Key Differences:**

| Feature                      | `vector<int> &arr` (Reference)                  | `vector<int> arr` (Value)                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Modifies original array?** | Yes, changes affect the original array.         | No, changes only affect the local copy.       |
| **Memory Efficiency**        | More efficient (no copy of the array).          | Less efficient (creates a copy of the array). |
| **Use Case**                 | Use when you want to modify the array directly. | Use when you don’t need to modify the array.  |

### **When to use each in your context:**

- In your function `removeDuplicatesOptimal`, you **want to modify the original array** by removing duplicates in place. Therefore, **passing by reference** (`vector<int> &arr`) is the best choice.
- If you passed the array by value (`vector<int> arr`), the function would work on a copy of the array, and the original array would remain unchanged after the function call.

### **Example with Reference (preferred):**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int removeDuplicatesOptimal(vector<int> &arr, int n)
{
    int i = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
    {
        if (arr[i] != arr[j])
        {
            arr[i + 1] = arr[j];
            i++;
        }
    }
    return i + 1;
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> arr = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5};
    int n = arr.size();

    // Call the function with reference
    int newLength = removeDuplicatesOptimal(arr, n);

    // Output the modified array
    cout << "New Length: " << newLength << endl;
    cout << "Modified Array: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < newLength; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

In this case, the original `arr` will be modified, and the duplicates will be removed in place.

---

### **Example with Value (if you don’t want to modify the original array):**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int removeDuplicatesOptimal(vector<int> arr, int n) // Passing by value
{
    int i = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
    {
        if (arr[i] != arr[j])
        {
            arr[i + 1] = arr[j];
            i++;
        }
    }
    return i + 1;
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> arr = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5};
    int n = arr.size();

    // Call the function with value
    int newLength = removeDuplicatesOptimal(arr, n); // arr will NOT be modified here

    // Output the modified array (but note that arr is not modified)
    cout << "New Length: " << newLength << endl;
    cout << "Modified Array: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < newLength; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

In this case, `arr` in `main` remains unchanged after the function call, and the function works on a copy of the array.

---

### **Summary:**

- Use **`&arr` (pass by reference)** when you need to modify the original array inside the function.
- Use **`arr` (pass by value)** when you don't need to modify the array and are okay with working on a copy.

In most cases where you want to modify an array or container inside a function, **passing by reference** is the more common and efficient choice.
