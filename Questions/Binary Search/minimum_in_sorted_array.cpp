/*

Your Original Code:
high = mid - 1;
answer = min(answer, arr[mid]);


Here:
You update high, eliminating the right half. Then you update answer with arr[mid]. This is fine, because arr[mid] is still accessible before changing any boundaries.

ðŸ”„ Reversed Order:
answer = min(answer, arr[mid]);
high = mid - 1;


This is also fine, and arguably better, because:
You're evaluating arr[mid] while all indices are still valid. Then you move the high pointer to continue the loop.

âœ… Conclusion:
In this specific case, both orders are equivalent and safe, because:
arr[mid] is calculated before either line.

You're not accessing arr[high] or arr[low] after modifying them.
However, as a general habit, it's safer to perform logic based on values first, then update indices â€” to avoid subtle bugs in more complex algorithms.

ðŸ§  Rule of Thumb:
ðŸ’¡ Always use array values before modifying indices, unless you're absolutely sure index changes won't affect subsequent operations.
