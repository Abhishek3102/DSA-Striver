/*

contains elements of same data type.
if declared inside int main() then garbage value will be stored inside array if nothing else is initialized.
and if declared globally then zeros will be stored inside array if nothing is initialized.


max size of array declared inside int main() is 10^6 i.e. arr[10^6]
and if declared globally then max size is 10^7, i.e. arr[10^7]

Accessing an array :  By index. starts from 0 ends at n-1
Accessing arrays by address is not possible so we access it by index.
